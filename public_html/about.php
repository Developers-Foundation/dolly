                        From my experiences, I believe that access to a conducive learning environment, quality
                        educational programmes, provision of educational aids and financial support to the less -
                        privileged children of the communities are crucial needs,  and these aforementioned
                        values remain the core of our foundation.

                        DCF holds weekly reading club meetings in the public primary schools in communities we serve.
                        This is to engage the children in activities that will cultivate a reading culture in them.

                        Our choices of books are those that are able to inspire them for excellence, leadership and
                        increase their literacy abilities. This has resulted to a marked improvement in the interest of
                        children towards reading and has improved their ability to express themselves.

                        The plight of these children before our intervention was inability to access desired and

                        DCF provides and equips children with basic educational tools, school uniforms, shoes, bags etc.
                        The initiative has also helped in bringing back out of school children to schools by covering
                        tuition fees, and needs.  This has helped to motivate, as well as boost their confidence,
                        and participation in school activities.

                        Since 2015, we have embarked on the “adopt - a - school project” which we carry out in public
                        primary schools where the school structures are dilapidated. We move in to upgrade the
                        facilities and equip such schools with the necessary educational materials. Thus far a block of
                        four classes, a staff office, library and store have been built from scratch.

                        <br>
                        The project has helped in providing a healthy learning for the children that enhance their
                        academic performance and increase in school enrollment.
